###Introduction
Clojure is a dynamic programming language that targets the Java Virtual Machine. It is designed to be a general-purpose language, with the approachability and interactive development of a scripting language and an efficient and robust infrastructure for multithreaded server programming. Clojure is a compiled language - it compiles directly to JVM bytecode, yet remains completely dynamic. *Every* feature supported by Clojure is supported at runtime. Clojure provides easy access to the Java frameworks, and optional typing with type inference, to ensure that calls to Java can avoid reflection. 

Clojure is a dialect of Lisp, and shares with Lisp the code-as-data philosophy and a powerful macro system. Clojure is predominantly a functional language, and features a rich set of immutable, persistent data structures. When mutable state is needed, Clojure offers a software transactional memory system that ensures clean, correct, multithreaded designs.
